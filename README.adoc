= How to use the examples in this repo

== Batch processing

The default processor config is set to batch:

```
processors:
  batch:
  spanmetrics:
    metrics_exporter: prometheus

service:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [jaeger]
      processors: [spanmetrics, batch]
```

== Tail-sampling

To enable `tail_sampling`, make sure your _otel-collector-config.yml_ has the following configuration:

```processors:
  tail_sampling:
    decision_wait: 10s
    num_traces: 100
    expected_new_traces_per_sec: 10
    policies:
      [
        {
          name: latency-policy,
          type: latency,
          latency: { threshold_ms: 5000 }
        },
        {
          name: status-code-policy,
          type: status_code,
          status_code: { status_codes: [ ERROR, OK ] }
        },
        {
          name: string-policy,
          type: string_attribute,
          string_attribute: { key: alarm, values: [ unexpected ] }
        }
      ]
  spanmetrics:
    metrics_exporter: prometheus

service:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [jaeger]
      processors: [spanmetrics, tail_sampling]
```

Also, use `quarkus.opentelemetry.tracer.sampler=on` in Quarkus configuration.

== Using the trace-debug-id header

If you would like to use the extra attribute for debugging, you can try the following command:

```
curl -H 'trace-debug-id:local' http://localhost:8082/activity/type/busywork
```
